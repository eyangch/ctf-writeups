## [1] Here ya go!
**Problem:**

[here_ya_go.txt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OAv-eUr64hIWnsYqCZE6Qwb3gwo1DjjR/view)

**Solution:**

The flag is located inside the text file. Opening it produces `flag{well_that_was_easy}`.

## [25] ABC… it’s as easy as 123…
**Problem:**

Gabe passes secret notes to Gabby in class without the teacher noticing, but I managed to intercept one. The problem is, there’s no words! What does this mean?

6-12-1-7 { 5-1-19-25 _ 1-19 _ 15-14-5 _ 20-23-15 _  20-8-18-5-5 }

**Solution:**

This is a A1Z26 cipher, and inputting the encrypted text into an online decoder produces the result `flag{easy_as_one_two_three}`.

## [50] Extension Cord
**Problem:**

My file isn’t working! Please fix it. [extension_cord.txt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1433OBKxxtQbfvm185LXRsiu25nLS7e0P/view)

Hint: Computers need a way to tell different types of files apart.

**Solution:**

By running `file extension_cord.txt` which outputs `extension_cord.txt: PNG image data, 1920 x 1188, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced`, we learn that
the file is of a PNG format. Renaming extension_cord.txt to extension_cord.png and opening gives us `flag{dot_png_bro}`.

## [25] Ass Key

**Problem:**

I stole this straight off the server’s hard drive, but it doesn’t make any sense. Maybe these numbers mean something?

0110011001101100011000010110011101111011010000010101001101000011010010010100100101011111011010010111001101011111010001010101101001111101

Hint: Computers encode legible text as binary numbers using a certain format.

**Solution:**

This text is obviously in binary, so using an online decoder will produce `flag{ASCII_is_EZ}`.

## [75] Swift Swiftly

**Problem**

Aha! You know Swift, right? Try to hack into this for me. [swiftSwiftly.swift](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zu4Tr1eZqQm4Q-a0ppbaGWFsCvyZsy8N/view)

**Solution**

I actually don't know Swift. However, scanning the code reveals that the flag is encoded within this function:

```swift
func checkPassword(password:String) -> Bool {
    let arr = Array(password)
    return password.count == 31 &&
      arr[0]  == "s" &&
      arr[29] == "o" &&
      arr[4]  == "t" &&
      arr[2]  == "i" &&
      arr[23] == "r" &&
      arr[3]  == "f" &&
      arr[17] == "a" &&
      arr[1]  == "w" &&
      arr[7]  == "s" &&
      arr[10] == "w" &&
      arr[5]  == "_" &&
      arr[9]  == "a" &&
      arr[11] == "e" &&
      arr[15] == "e" &&
      arr[8]  == "_" &&
      arr[12] == "s" &&
      arr[20] == "_" &&
      arr[14] == "m" &&
      arr[6]  == "i" &&
      arr[24] == "a" &&
      arr[18] == "n" &&
      arr[13] == "o" &&
      arr[19] == "d" &&
      arr[21] == "a" &&
      arr[16] == "_" &&
      arr[27] == "_" &&
      arr[30] == "o" &&
      arr[25] == "y" &&
      arr[22] == "r" &&
      arr[28] == "t" &&
      arr[26] == "s"
}
```

From this, we can rebuild the flag by looking at the array indexes. Wrapping the result in a `flag{}` gives us `flag{swift_is_awesome_and_arrays_too}`.

## [25] Stalker

**Problem:**

I want to find out where PewDiePie is hiding. I managed to get his IP address, will that help?

193.231.2.32

Hint: flag{USA_Allen}

**Solution:**

The hint gives us an idea about the formatting of the flag as a location (`flag{Country_City}`). Searching up the IP gives tells you that the IP is located in Bucharest, Romania, so the flag is `flag{Romania_Bucharest}`.

## [75] It's all about that base

**Problem:**

The CS I students are getting really good at base conversions! But this number doesn’t look like any of the bases they’ve seen before… why don’t you convert it to decimal so the students understand it: 

888888888

Hint: Look at the largest digit in the provided number.

**Solution:**

This is obviously some sort of base conversion problem, and based on the hint, we can infer that the number is in base-9. Converting it online gives us the number 387420488. Wrapping it in a flag gives `flag{387420488}`.

## [225] I’m Buffer than you

**Problem:**

What if the value you assign to a buffer is larger than the space allocated for it in memory? Hmm… I wonder if we could exploit this…

Source: [imbufferthanyou.c](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pnW_CP1Asdzvy3hRg6Y0uuEGorqJQQ4b/view) Executable (exe): [imbufferthanyou.exe](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15P3So6qfcmljSZWSrLbTl6IdxgNE0OUX/view) Executable (ELF): [imbufferthanyou](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cer6pPwq70sSXV0RNL8B5HkJDokff_IE/view)

Hint: Make the file executable on Linux using chmod u+x imbufferthanyou.elf. On windows, run using the command line.

Hint: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow

Hint: If you think you are close but it’s not working, remember little endian.

**Solution:**

There is an unintended solution to this due to the fact that this wasn't a netcat challenge. This means that the flag itself is stored in the executable. Running the `strings` command can reveal the flag. Running `strings imbufferthanyou | grep "flag{"` searches for occurences for flag{ in the program, and that produces `flag{th@t_buff3r_aint_so_buff_n0w}`.

The intended solution was to exploit buffer overflow, as mentioned in the problem and hints. The program is helpful, as it prints the memory address of the buffer array and the secret integer to modify. Because the program uses the `gets()` function, we can assume that the program is vulnerable to buffer overflow. The distance from the secret integer to the beginning of the buffer array is 1c in hexadecimal, or 28 in decimal. This means that after printing out 28 characters, the next characters will start to modify the secret integer. However, the value of the integer has to be represented in little endian, so the hexadecimal values for the integer will be reversed (in groups of 2). We can generate the input to the program in python and pipe it into the program. Our desired command is `python -c "print('a' * 28 + '\x62\x75\x66\x66')" | ./imbufferthanyou`. This prints 28 'a's, filling up the space between the start of the buffer array and the secret integer. Then, it prints 0x66667562 in little endian form. This sets the value of the secret integer to the desired value, printing the flag. The resulting flag is `flag{th@t_buff3r_aint_so_buff_n0w}`.

## [175] Unzip.. Unzip... Unzip... Unzip..

**Problem:**

1000 zips in a zip

1000 zips in a zip

Zip one out, check it out 

999 zips in a zip

[1000.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SsnESd5aNygPBB-LPClw2rr69sM-GQpQ/view)

Hint: Script the unzip

**Solution:**

A look at the zip and the problem tells us the file is probably 1000 zips inside each other. Taking advice from the hint, we will script the unzip. Luckily, python has a builtin zip library, so we can write the following code to do the unzipping for us.

```python
import zipfile
import os

for i in range(1000, 0, -1):
    with zipfile.ZipFile(str(i)+".zip", "r") as z:
        z.extractall(".")
    if i > 1:
        os.remove(str(i)+".zip")
```

The last zip file has a folder in it with a file called flag.txt with `flag{look_at_all_those_zips}`.
