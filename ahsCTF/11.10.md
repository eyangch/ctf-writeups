## [1] Here ya go!
**Problem:**

[here_ya_go.txt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OAv-eUr64hIWnsYqCZE6Qwb3gwo1DjjR/view)

**Solution:**

The flag is located inside the text file. Opening it produces `flag{well_that_was_easy}`.

## [25] ABC… it’s as easy as 123…
**Problem:**

Gabe passes secret notes to Gabby in class without the teacher noticing, but I managed to intercept one. The problem is, there’s no words! What does this mean?

6-12-1-7 { 5-1-19-25 _ 1-19 _ 15-14-5 _ 20-23-15 _  20-8-18-5-5 }

**Solution:**

This is a A1Z26 cipher, and inputting the encrypted text into an online decoder produces the result `flag{easy_as_one_two_three}`.

## [50] Extension Cord
**Problem:**

My file isn’t working! Please fix it. [extension_cord.txt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1433OBKxxtQbfvm185LXRsiu25nLS7e0P/view)

Hint: Computers need a way to tell different types of files apart.

**Solution:**

By running `file extension_cord.txt` which outputs `extension_cord.txt: PNG image data, 1920 x 1188, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced`, we learn that
the file is of a PNG format. Renaming extension_cord.txt to extension_cord.png and opening gives us `flag{dot_png_bro}`.
